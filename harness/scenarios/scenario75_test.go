// Scenario 75 — NACK repair across an INTER-FABRIC path
//
// Why this exists: every prior NACK proof (scenario 99) ran on an unshaped
// container veth at ~0.8ms RTT. Production, and the current standard ops posture,
// join regions over an interconnect at 60-160ms RTT — three orders of magnitude
// slower. Timing that repairs perfectly on a LAN can misbehave there for a reason
// that never appears unshaped: the retry interval is compared against the round
// trip, not against the loss rate.
//
// The hypothesis it was written to test was BackoffBase vs RTT: if a retry fires
// before the reply to the previous NACK lands, the listener burns its MaxRetries
// budget re-asking for frames already in flight. MEASUREMENT REFUTED THAT as a
// mechanism at any RTT an interconnect actually shows, and the refutation is the
// useful part of this scenario, so it is recorded rather than deleted: sendNACK
// drains the socket INLINE for respTimeout (300ms, not configurable) before the
// gap is ever rescheduled, so the next attempt cannot be issued until 300ms have
// passed no matter how small BackoffBase is. A 60-160ms round trip is absorbed
// whole. The race needs RTT > 300ms — half a second of round trip, which is not
// an interconnect, it is a satellite hop.
//
// What the rig CAN resolve, and what actually decides the defaults, is whether
// the slower inter-fabric timing COSTS anything: recovery must hold up in
// absolute terms, and must not fall below what LAN timing achieves on the same
// path. That is what the guards at the bottom assert. The load difference
// (NACKs and rate-limit drops at the retry endpoint) is logged, because it is
// the reason to prefer the slower ladder once recovery is shown to be equal.
//
// Shaping: netem is attached to the HOST-SIDE veth root qdisc, which delays and
// drops traffic INTO the container — the listener's ingress only. So the data
// path carries owDelayMs of latency and lossPct of loss, while the listener's
// NACK leaves unshaped and only the reply is delayed: a NACK exchange costs ONE
// leg, ~owDelayMs, not 2*owDelayMs. Naming it an 80ms RTT (as this scenario did)
// overstates it by 2x. Shaping the retry endpoint as well to close that gap was
// tried and rejected — see the note at the qdisc below; it is why the numbers
// here are quoted against owDelayMs, and why the header's claim about what the
// path costs is stated once, here, rather than implied by the constant's name.

		// was flaky. netem jitter reorders whenever it exceeds the inter-packet
		// gap, and 8ms of jitter on a 1ms gap reordered constantly: runs recorded
		// ~12000 detected gaps against ~2700 real losses, so four fifths of the
		// "loss" this scenario measured was reordering. Each phantom gap is a
		// NACK the retry endpoint has to admit, and once that volume crossed the
		// endpoint's rate limit (RL_IP_RATE 100/s) the drops became retries and
		// the retries became more drops: three runs collapsed into that mode
		// (ratio 0.49-0.84, up to 34k rate-limit drops) while three stayed healthy
		// (ratio 0.95-0.99, <600 drops), and WHICH variant collapsed was random.
		// No threshold can be set across a bimodal distribution — the mode had to
		// go. 2ms of jitter on a 4ms gap leaves reordering present but occasional,
		// which is all this scenario needs; deliberate forward-jump coverage is
